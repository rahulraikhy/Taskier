<!-- ROADMAP -->

## Project Brief

- Working MERN stack app.
- Token-based authentication implemented (sign-up, login & logout)
- Navigation dynamically responds to the login status of the user.
- Authorization is implemented that restricts access to CRUD functionality from anonymous users
- Have a consistent and polished user interface.
- App has full Create/Read/Update/Delete and/or consumes an API, has admin user functionality or real time communication.
- Be deployed online via Heroku

## ERD

## Wireframe

## MVP - Minimum Viable Product

- [x] A way to login and logout
- [x] Create a new task
- [x] Submit and edit said task
- [x] Ability to delete tasks
- [x] Navigate to All Tasks Page to see all user's tasks

## NTH - Nice to have

- [ ] Implement drag and drop functionality across tasks
- [ ] Allow other users to comment and contribute to tasks

## Actual Project Screenshots



## Biggest Challenge

Implementing the drag and drop functionality.

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

## Next Steps

- Improve UI/User Experience
- Implement the drag and drop functionality

## Wins

- **Creating an app people want to use.** I wanted to make something that highlighted the topics I'm learning, and satisfies the project brief, but also something that I'd use and others want to use.

## Mistakes / Bugs

- **Mobile responsivity** Currently there is very minimal mobile responsiveness due to time constraints.

## Key Learnings

- **Mobile responsiveness first**It became very difficult to go back and tailer my content to mobile views, as such, implementing this first next project would be beneficial.
