## Actual Project Screenshots



## Biggest Challenge

Implementing the drag and drop functionality.

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

## Next Steps

- Improve UI/User Experience
- Implement the drag and drop functionality

## Wins

- **Creating an app people want to use.** I wanted to make something that highlighted the topics I'm learning, and satisfies the project brief, but also something that I'd use and others want to use.

## Mistakes / Bugs

- **Mobile responsivity** Currently there is very minimal mobile responsiveness due to time constraints.

## Key Learnings

- **Mobile responsiveness first**It became very difficult to go back and tailer my content to mobile views, as such, implementing this first next project would be beneficial.
